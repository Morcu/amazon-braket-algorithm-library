The `random_circuit` function generates a random quantum circuit using the Braket framework. It's designed to construct a circuit with a specified number of qubits, instructions, and a minimum qubit requirement for each gate. This function is useful for creating diverse quantum circuits, which can be beneficial in testing quantum algorithms or in quantum machine learning applications.
